Refresh Switch GNOME extension
==============================
This is a GNOME shell extension to allow convenient switching of your
monitor(s) refresh rate without having to navigate through the GNOME settings
app.

The extension is still a work in progress. The UI is currently implemented in
the extension's preferences dialog. This made it easier to test, and to make it
easier to use in case the display is a TV which overscans in some modes. This
could change if I can't find a way to fix the dialog being oversized.

In future I intend to include a control for turning fullscreen redirect on and
off.
